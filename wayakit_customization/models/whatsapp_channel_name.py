"""Pure helper that builds the name of a WhatsApp discuss channel.

No Odoo imports on purpose: same trick as models/review_text.py and
trendyol_connector/models/mapping.py, so tests/test_whatsapp_channel_name.py
runs with plain python.

Background: enterprise commit 8fe680ab ("whatsapp_identifiers: support for
business-scoped user IDs", July 2026) made the channel name default to the
WhatsApp profile push name, leaving the phone number as a mere fallback. Sales
KSA copies that number to follow up once the 24h WhatsApp window closes, so we
put it back in front.
